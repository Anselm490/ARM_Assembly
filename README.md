## Usage of programs
After running `make` to run a given program:

``` bash
./program ; echo $? 
```	

## Assembling and Linking
For assembling any given program, just navigate into that Chapter and `make all`, that will create a executable for all the programs in the Chapter.

Or you can use the global Makefile to compile all the programs in all Chapters, using `make all`
